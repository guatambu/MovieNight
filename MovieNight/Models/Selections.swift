    //the users selections comparison will:
    //look in the two genre arrays for any overlap
    //look in the two people arrays for any overlap
    //then it will spit out an array removing any overlapping duplicates and generate a MovieAPI URL for the network call for those overlapping strings
    //if there is no overlap between the users two selections, then it will spit out an array of all the strings present
        //case 1: using the overlapping strings as query parameters to query the MovieDB API using *** and/or *** query parameters to get all results including the overlapping user selections
            //this results in an "OR" query where any multiples of query items, be they genres or people will be, and they will be using the "|" to separate the items in the list of query items
        //case 2: an alert window will come up giving the users a warning that their selections produed no common results and they will be given the choice to proceed with a search that includes all their various input which could be quite a lot of results or to start over and try again for some overlap
            //this results in an "OR" query where any multiples of query items, be they genres or people will be, and they will be using the "|" to separate the items in the list of query items which is liekly to be a very long list of returned items
        //from here, the network call will be made with a MovieDB API "discover" query
    //the YourResultsTableViewController will then display the results of the above network call
